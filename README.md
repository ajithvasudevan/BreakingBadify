# 'Breaking Bad'-ify
### Description:
This script takes text-files as input and constructs images corresponding to each word in the text-file using the symbols from the periodic table of elements (to the highest degree possible). 

The program then generates a html file (index.html) which displays all the generated images, making up the original sentences within the text-file.

As you may have noticed, this style is reminescent of the logo of the show Breaking Bad.

To use the script on your own files, use the command:
`$ python3 BreakingBadify sampleFile`

Your word-images can be found in `out/` and the **index.html** file should be in the project's root folder.


You may find sample images in `out/`.
